# abap-examples

A list of simple SAP ABAP reports. Written mainly for content for my YouTube tutorial channel, but if they're helpful, feel free to use these.

| Program                                            | Description                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Z_SIMPLE_ALV_GRID](./Z_SIMPLE_ALV_GRID.abap)      | Demonstrates using the REUSE_ALV_GRID_DISPLAY function module.      |
| [Z_TCODE_INFO](./Z_TCODE_INFO.abap)                | Report on custom tcodes and their author.                           |
| [Z_LOCKED_USERS](./Z_LOCKED_USERS.abap)            | Uses cl_salv_table to display report of user lock status.           |

**NOTE:** These reports are pretty plug and play, you can copy them into your SAP's SE38 and run them as is. No custom fields, data dictionary entries, or any other install specific config will be present.
